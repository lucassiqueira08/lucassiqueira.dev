# Who am I?
Hi there, I'm Lucas, a software developer from Brazil, deeply passionate about programming and technology. This project is my portfolio, my blog, and the place where I will be sharing my thoughts.

# Tech Stack
TypeScript - For better code quality and development experience.
NextJS - To combine client-side rendering (CSR) and server-side rendering (SSR), as well as to gain some practical experience.
FramerMotion - Just to sprinkle in some fun and lively animations :)
